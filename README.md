# Multi-Agent-RL-simulating-collaboration-with-VDN-and-IQL

## Project description
The goal of the project was to simulate collaborative behaviour in a custom multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) environment. We look at two types of algorithms: Independent Q-Learning (IQL) and Value Decomposition Network (VDN). The environment used is a Food Collector env detailed in the [Environment description](#environment-description) section. The results are shown below. We can see clear collaborative behaviour from VDN, while the independent learning apprach leads to more indiviudalistic, greedy behaviour:

The motivation comes mainly from two projects:
- [Simulating Green Beard Altruism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goePYJ74Ydg), which explores the effects of natural selection on behaviour
- [Emergent Tool Use from Multi-Agent Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.07528) by OpenAI, which explores complex collaborative behaviour in RL agents.
